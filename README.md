# German Cavani

👋 Hi, I'm German Cavani, a web developer and aspiring analyst programmer with a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and making a positive impact on the world. My love for creating new things and helping others has led me to specialize in web development using HTML, JavaScript, React, Next.js, CSS, and other related technologies.

🎓 **Educational Background**
Currently, I'm studying at Universidad ORT, pursuing a degree in analyst programming. I'm also an avid learner, and I've honed my skills through various online platforms like Platzi and other online resources.

💻 **Areas of Expertise**
I have expertise in developing web applications, building responsive UIs, and creating engaging user experiences. I'm also skilled in working with modern web frameworks like React and Next.js. In addition, I'm always eager to learn new tools and technologies that can help me improve my work.

🚀 **Notable Projects**
- Kwang Gae App: An application for taekwondo instructors and students that allows students to register, track points, and exchange virtual figurines. The app can also be used for arbitration and quiz contests.
- Empathy Chatbot Juan: A chatbot that helps children practice empathy.

🌐 **Industries & Interests**
I'm particularly interested in applying my skills to innovative projects, especially those related to education. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and a person.

🥋 **Interests Outside of Programming**
Aside from my work in programming, I'm also an experienced taekwondo instructor with over a decade of teaching experience. I've trained over 300 students and instructors and achieved a significant milestone of coaching Uruguay's only medalist in the ITF Taekwondo World Championships (Slovenia 2022). When I'm not coding or practicing taekwondo, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and exploring new places.

Let's connect and see how we can work together! 😄
